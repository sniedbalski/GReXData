\f0\fs24 \cf0 Notes for the Report\
\
In the \'91Data for Report\'92 Folder you should find all of the data that has been collected that encompasses the entire bandpass region. Use this instead of the previous data as it gives a fuller picture of the RFI environment. The frequency range for this data is 1150-1750 MHz. The time ranges are given in the file names, ranging from .3-1 hr. The plots to make are a plot with the average, max, min, and quartiles for the intensity as a function of frequency for each site and attenuation. Also include a dynamic spectrum for each site and attenuation. Finally, include two plots (one for each attenuation) that includes the average intensity from each site so that a good comparison can be made.}
